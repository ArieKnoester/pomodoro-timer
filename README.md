# pomodoro-timer

A Pomodoro Timer application created as part of a Python course.
In this lesson, students get more familiar with Tkinter and using
methods which take *args and **kwargs. The image, tomato.png, was 
provided by the course.

#### Note

I had considered cleaning main.py up a bit by moving some Tkinter
objects to their own classes. However, I ultimately decided it was
not worth the effort as I did not see a need for this application
to be scalable.
